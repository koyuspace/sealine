Home of the Sealine Linux distribution. Work in progress.
Also available through Gemini at gemini://koyu.space/sealine/

Some objectives:
  - Wayland by default, vanilla GNOME Desktop
  - Nala package manager and Flatpak support
  - ZSH, Spaceship prompt and Fira Code
  - NVM, Git and Python preinstalled to start your next project

Maybe more to come.
